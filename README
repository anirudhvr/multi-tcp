What
====

Client and server for file transfers that use multiple TCP connections.
The idea is to get an unfair share of the bottleneck link bandwidth by
using multiple TCP connections.  From my tests, this outperforms
single-TCP file-transfers by 3x-8x in cross-country transfers.

The code is just about usable, and there's a ton of things to be done
to make it work better, but who has time?

Usage
=====

Run server.rb at one end

Run client.rb at other end
